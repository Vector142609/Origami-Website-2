<h2>Facts about Flamingo.</h2>
<h2>The word "flamingo" comes from the Spanish and Latin word "flamenco" which means fire, and refers to the bright color of the birds' feathers.</h2>
<h2>Not all flamingos are brightly colored, however, and some of the birds are mostly gray or white.</h2>
<h2>The strength of a flamingo's coloration comes from its diet. Younger birds also have less coloration.</h2>
